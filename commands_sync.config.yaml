# Configuration for syncing command prompt files across providers
# Each entry defines a command "core name" and the files that must stay in sync
# along with provider-specific header/footers.

commands:
  - name: emails
    files:
      claude:
        path: .claude/commands/emails.md
        header: |
          ---
          argument-hint: Day reference, like today, tomorrow, yesterday, next Tuesday
          description: Lists Google Calendar events
          allowed-tools: [list_unread_emails, delete_email, archive_email]
          ---
        footer: ""
      cursor:
        path: .cursor/commands/emails.md
        header: ""
        footer: ""
      gemini:
        path: .gemini/commands/emails.toml
        header: |
          description = "emails"
          prompt = """
        footer: '"""'

# Behavior tuning
# - primary_provider is the canonical source when a sync conflict occurs
# - If omitted, the most recently modified of the three becomes primary
primary_provider: auto

# Notes:
# - The script should always preserve existing indentation and whitespace.
# - Gemini TOML prompts must end with a closing triple quote on the last line.
